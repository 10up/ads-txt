# Ads.txt Manager for WordPress

Create, manage, and validate your Ads.txt from within WordPress.

## Description

Ads.txt is an initiative by the Interactive Advertising Bureau to enable publishers to take control over who can sell their ad inventory. Through our work at 10up with various publishers, we've created a way to manage and validate your Ads.txt file from within WordPress, eliminating the need to upload a file. The validation baked into the plugin helps avoid malformed records, which can cause issues that end up cached for up to 24 hours and can lead to a drop in ad revenue.

### What about Ads.cert?

We're closely monitoring continued developments in the ad fraud space, and see this plugin as not only a way to create and manage your Ads.txt file but also be prepared for future changes and upgrades to specifications. Ads.cert is still in the extremely early stages so we don't see any immediate concerns with implementing Ads.txt.
